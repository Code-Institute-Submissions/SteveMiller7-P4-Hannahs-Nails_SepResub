My website presents Hannah's Nail Bar. Based in Auchterarder, Perthshire, Scotland. Users will be 
able to find information on the salon and hannah herself. Images of past work are presented in the Inspiration page.
Information on prices as well as the option to create a user account, make, amend and delete online bookings are also available. 

This is a full stack data model web application structured using Django and Bootstraps and featuring authentication and permissions features.  

Contact information can be found in the footer of each page along side social media links and site navigation links.

Aesthetically, the aim was to create a clean, soft, user friendly site to tie in with the floral presentation of hannah's salon.

## Navigation Bar with Off Canvas

![Fetaure-Navbar](https://res.cloudinary.com/millermayhem/image/upload/v1654774468/Screenshot_2022-06-09_at_12.32.44_nk8o5x.png)

The Navigation Bar is located at the top of each page and is consitent in style throughout the site. 

A business logo is placed to the left and will navigate you to the home page when clicked.
The burger icon opens the off canvas content which contains navigation links around the site. 
I decided to have the nav bar stuck to the top of the screen with an opacity applied which has a nice feel.

Links to each page are included for easy navigation to:
- Home
- Inspiration
- Prices
