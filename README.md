# Portfolio Project 4 - Full Stack Toolkit - Hannah's Nail Bar
***

![mockup](https://res.cloudinary.com/millermayhem/image/upload/v1654770340/Screens_mockup_sde3gr.png)
##  [Visit the site on Heroku]([https://stevemiller7.github.io/Bad_Dog_Portfolio_1/](https://hannahs-nails.herokuapp.com/)).

My website presents Hannah's Nail Bar. Based in Auchterarder, Perthshire, Scotland. Users will be 
able to find information on the salon and hannah herself. Images of past work are presented in the Inspiration page.
Information on prices as well as the option to create a user account, make, amend and delete online bookings are also available. 

This is a full stack data model web application structured using Django and Bootstraps and featuring authentication and permissions features.  

Contact information can be found in the footer of each page along side social media links and site navigation links.

Aesthetically, the aim was to create a clean, soft, user friendly site to tie in with the floral presentation of hannah's salon.
